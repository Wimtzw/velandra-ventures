## Narfingani
A city without a teleportation circle. It is located on the edge of a dense forest. In the past people who didn't like the trading moved from [Paidwarwa](./Paidwarwa.md) to here. It mainly focuses on producing timber for exports. Most people travelling from [Zanda](./Zanda.md) or one of the smaller villages rest here before continuing their trek towards [Paidwarwa](./Paidwarwa.md)
