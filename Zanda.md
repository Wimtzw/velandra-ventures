## Zanda
Zanda is an city that started out as a military encampment. To this day the order can be felt in it's streets as well. It does not take kindly to people who don't appreciate it's values. Currently it is used as a place for training military and has a teleportation circle used to quickly provide reinforcements if [Velandra](./Velandra.md) where to be attacked from somewhere.
