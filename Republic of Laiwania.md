## Republic of Laiwania
The republic of Laiwania is located on the south west of [Praxidon](./Praxidon.md), sharing a border with the [Kingdom of Domia](./Kingdom%20of%20Domia.md), [Principality of Khangehia](./Principality%20of%20Khangehia.md) and [Kwaihung](./Kwaihung.md) in the north, north east and east respectively.

A few generations ago this was still known as the kingdom of Laiwania, but 70 years ago there was a massive civil uprising that took place in it's borders. The people seized control of the country and turned it into a republic over serveral years. Currently it is lead by minister [Ylvis Peterson](Ylvis%20Peterson.md). Most people love that it is a republic now and that people can cast their votes on multiple issues each year. A small group of people believe they would be better under a king. Beyond the fact that people can vote here, Laiwania is known to house the best producers when it comes to making steam powered machinery. It's capital city [Lukho](Lukho.md) has both a shipyard for airships as well as regular ships.
