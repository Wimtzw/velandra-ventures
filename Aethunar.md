If needed to be described in one sentence, people would say "Balanced with nature" to describe Aethunar. The lifestyle in general seems to not have changed for the past 200 years or so. In the country side you have small towns and villages living off the land. Trading small things between each-other if needed. Accidents and diseases still happen as they would happen anywhere, but a skilled magic healer is never to far away from anyone. It still is a place built by magic users for magic users. Stairs in most rural area's don't really exist beyond people showing off their carpentry skills. Fields with crops seem to be growing all year round. There are roads between the smallest towns, but all cities and most large villages have a teleportation circle. Speaking of cities, they are the place where the most powerful magic users reside. Where streets are illuminated by magic at night, skilled magic users conjure up the most delicious food for them to eat without ever getting full, whilst battle mages patrol the area and lock away those that oppose them. Balanced with nature, but not necessarily balanced for the people. The lineage of people you find here are most of those that are either magic touched or have magic within them. Humans are here, but aren't common.
