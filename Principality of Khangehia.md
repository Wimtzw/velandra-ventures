## Principality of Khangehia
The Principality of Khangehia is located in the midwest of [Praxidon](./Praxidon.md), it shares a border with every state of the continent. In the north it's [Mukian Theocracy](./Mukian%20Theocracy.md), northwest [Kingdom of Domia](./Kingdom%20of%20Domia.md), south-west and south it's [Republic of Laiwania](./Republic%20of%20Laiwania.md) and south-south-east is [Kwaihung](./Kwaihung.md). 

It is currently under the rule of prince [Andrea Khan](Andrea%20Khan.md). In the past it used to be two separate principalities, that of Khan and of Gehia. Whereas nowadays there is very little that still points to Khangehia ever being separated, all that there still is, is now in a museum located in the capital city [Tibababas](Tibababas.md). What Khangehia is known for, is that most marble that is used comes from the region of [Narim](Narim.md) where it is transported by boat to the capital. Although it technically has a border with the [Republic of Laiwania](./Republic%20of%20Laiwania.md), since it is fully a mountain range, it is impossible to travel from Laiwania to Khangehia. The people here might seem rude at first, but once they open up to you they are the kindest folk you've ever met.
