Velandra is known for many things. First of all it is known for trade. A lot of it's landmass is taken up by farmland and forests, with only a few cities and villages existing on the island. Due to it's unique location their harvests are bountiful and plentiful. Seeing as their population is relatively low, they export most of their foods to both of the continents. Some of these products are well known around the world and highly praised, such as Velandra Mead and Velandra steak. Besides trading their own grown goods, Velandra acts as a trading hub between the two larger continents. This is why three of it's largest cities (Vinxa , Renama and Paidwarwa) are ports scattered around the south of the island.
