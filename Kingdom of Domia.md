## Kingdom of Domia
The kingdom of Domia is a nation located in the north west of [Praxidon](./Praxidon.md), bordering the [Mukian Theocracy](./Mukian%20Theocracy.md), [Principality of Khangehia](./Principality%20of%20Khangehia.md) and the [Republic of Laiwania](./Republic%20of%20Laiwania.md) on the east, south east and south respectively.


It is currently under the rule of king [Zeddicus Domia](Zeddicus%20Domia.md), who rules from the capital city [Domia city](Domia%20city.md), what lies in the domia county. Creativity is not one of the things this nation is known for. What it is known for is hard workers. Not only do the people here do most of the trade with [Velandra](./Velandra.md), they also are the people who organise the transporting the good from their own kingdom to the rest of the continent. It is not that they are unfamiliar with humour as a whole, they would much rather just go and do the work. Most towns have a statue in their town centre depicting [Zeddicus Domia](Zeddicus%20Domia.md), made from stone.
