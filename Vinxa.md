## Vinxa
Vinxa is one of the three port towns that [Velandra](./Velandra.md) has. Unlike the other two port cities ([Renama](./Renama.md) and [Paidwarwa](./Paidwarwa.md)), it's main focus isn't trade. Vinxa is mostly a fishing village that in it's past housed military to protect itself were it ever invaded. Nowadays it mostly serves as a last place to take in supplies before heading to [Aethunar](./Aethunar.md).
