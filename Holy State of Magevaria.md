It used to be a collection of smaller nations in the past that banded together when a war broke out between them and what is now known as the [Kingdom of Diton](./Kingdom%20of%20Diton.md). Since it houses multiple large temples to different deities it was decided that the name for the state would become *Holy State of Magevaria*.
