## Kwaihung
Kwaihung is located on the south west of [Praxidon](./Praxidon.md), it has a border with the [Principality of Khangehia](./Principality%20of%20Khangehia.md) on the north and a border with the [Republic of Laiwania](./Republic%20of%20Laiwania.md) on the east.

Not much is known about Kwaihung. What is odd. It is not much bigger than the [Mukian Theocracy](./Mukian%20Theocracy.md), yet most people know next to nothing about this area. Not many people have visited Kwaihung or its captial city [Kwaihung city](Kwaihung%20city.md). Those that have interacted with Kwaihung people know they don't like to talk more than absolutely required.

### GM's note:
Only if your backstory means you came from here will you get more information about Kwaihung.
