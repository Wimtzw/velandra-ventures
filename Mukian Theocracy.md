## Mukian Theocracy
The Mukian Teocracy is the smallest nation of [Praxidon](./Praxidon.md), having a border with the [Kingdom of Domia](./Kingdom%20of%20Domia.md) on the west, and a border with the [Principality of Khangehia](./Principality%20of%20Khangehia.md) on the south.

It is currently being lead by [Saint Benedictus the 4th](Saint%20Benedictus%20the%204th.md), leader as what is known there the [church of old faith](church%20of%20old%20faith.md). Religion in [Praxidon](./Praxidon.md) is on a very steep decline. The industrialisation the continent is going through is ruining the connection the land once had to magic. Churches devoted to a single deities were seeing less and less use, what brought fourth the need for a church where people could pray to multiple deities, so the church of old faith was born in Mukian, and spread further throughout the nation. Mukian is known for having a church for each deity in the capital city [nara](nara.md). Rumour has it as well that an elven city is located somewhere in Mukian. But that could just be a rumour. The people here are open and respectful, as long as you respect their religion and associated rules.
