Coedenwych is an old tortle druid that got trapped in [Paidwarwa](./Paidwarwa.md) by the incoming fog. He spends most of his days near the coast, as far away from the city as he can. He is a very slow talker and talks like an old grandpa. Yet he has mastered his trait and despite his old age most people would say he hasn't aged a day. 

His skin is as mix of an aged green brown looking shell and hard skin, with a lighter creme colour for his mouth, eyebrows, and inner hand and feet. He usually wears a brown overshirt with a white undershirt tucked underneath, not reaching the back of his shell. In his right hand he holds a cane made of walnut wood. His eyes are a green-brown mixture with dark black pupils. Around his neck attached by a simple rope is a locket of his druidic order. Often when no one is looking he can be seen using his left hand and rubbing it, missing his fellow members of the druidic order.
