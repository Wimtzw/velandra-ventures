The Principality of Avaanoei is a nation located in the south of [Aethunar](./Aethunar.md). It is bordered by the [Holy State of Magevaria](./Holy%20State%20of%20Magevaria.md) in the north,  and the [Principality of Avanoei](Principality%20of%20Avanoei.md) in the west.

Both the [Principality of gicushelit](./Principality%20of%20gicushelit.md) and the [Principality of Avanoei](Principality%20of%20Avanoei.md) used to be part of what is now known as the [Kingdom of Diton](./Kingdom%20of%20Diton.md). However, both principalities split from the kingdom after the crown was seized by a new family. Avanoei is currently lead by prince  [Gael  Sloan](Gael%20%20Sloan.md). Whilst most of the older generation here has had basic military training, the new generation growing up here has had more freedom.

Due to their history the people here don't like outsiders. As they have been at war the [Kingdom of Diton](./Kingdom%20of%20Diton.md) and the [Holy State of Magevaria](./Holy%20State%20of%20Magevaria.md) in the past.
