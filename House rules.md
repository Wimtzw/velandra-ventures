1. You get a heropoint everytime you roll a nat1 or nat20.
	- You will still get a hero point for the usual things, this is just an addition to that.
2. If you use your heropoint to reroll a check and roll lower, you get to roll again until your new roll is higher.
3. If *any* discussion (about rules) last longer than five minutes, we will go with the interpretation that suits the most affected player best. 
	- If it's a GM vs player situation, it will always be favouring the player. 
	- If needed we can spend time between sessions figuring out the exact rules. But in my eyes this shouldn't take up session time.
	- I'd much rather have you get a undeserved bonus or lucky break, than an undeserved punishment.
4. If anyone is uncomfortable with a situation in game, we will revert to before this taking place.
	- You can say so publicly
	- Send a message in chat
	- Send me a private message
	- If you feel this between sessions, same as above. Rolling it back might be harder to do, but we can always workshop it into something that just works
