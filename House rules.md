1. You get a heropoint everytime you roll a nat1 or nat20.
	- You will still get a hero point for the usual things, this is just an addition to that.
2. If you use your heropoint to reroll a check and roll lower, you get to roll again until your new roll is higher.
3. If *any* discussion (about rules or otherwise) last longer than five minutes, we will go with the interpretation that suits the most affected player best. 
	- If it's a GM vs player situation, it will always be favouring the player. 
	- If needed we can spend time between sessions figuring out the exact rules. But in my eyes this shouldn't take up session time.
	- I'd much rather have you get a undeserved bonus or lucky break, than an undeserved punishment.
4. Anyone **at any point** can demand a hard stop. No questions asked, no judgement, no debate.
	- You can say so publicly
	- Send a message in chat
	- Send me a private message
	- If you feel this between sessions, same as above. Rolling it back or changes might be harder to do, but changes will be made if you are not comfortable with the situation. Either retroactively or for the future.
